# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-09 after v1.0)

**Core value:** Customers can browse products and services, add to cart, and complete a real payment — every time, without security holes or data loss.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone — run `/gsd:new-milestone`

## Current Position

Phase: v1.0 complete — all 4 phases, 11 plans shipped
Status: Milestone archived — ready for next milestone planning
Last activity: 2026-04-09 — v1.0 Production Hardening milestone complete

Progress: [██████████] 100% (v1.0 complete)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (16 decisions across 4 phases).

Notable for next milestone:
- save-signed-document email still uses Gmail SMTP — deferred to future milestone
- Rate limiting is in-memory Map (cold-start caveat) — consider persistent solution if needed
- Resend FROM_ADDRESS is `onboarding@resend.dev` until thepartypalace.in is verified in Resend Dashboard
- Vases.featured=false in DB — needs manual SQL update in Supabase dashboard

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
